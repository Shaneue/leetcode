/**
 * Given a complete binary tree, count the number of nodes.
 *
 * Note:
 *
 * Definition of a complete binary tree from Wikipedia:
 * In a complete binary tree every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. It can have between 1 and 2h nodes inclusive at the last level h.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * Input:
 *     1
 *    / \
 *   2   3
 *  / \  /
 * 4  5 6
 *
 * Output: 6
 *
 * 因为是完全二叉树，可以降低复杂度来计算
 * 通过binary search来找最后一层的节点数
